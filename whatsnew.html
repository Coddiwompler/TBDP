    </div>
    <div class="container cover">
            <h2 class="title2 small">The Latest News</h2>
            <p>On Sunday, October 25, 2020 the final bulb was planted for the highly successful Belfast Daffodil Project 2020. With the goal of planting 1 Million Daffodils gleaming in the eyes of the town’s gardeners, over 26,350 bulbs were bought and/or planted this year. That makes a total of 102,500 since the project’s inception in 2018. Wahoo!
            <br><br>
            This year's sponsors included The City of Belfast, Worth Real Estate, and The Foot Nurse, all of whom want to send out huge thanks to the more than 165 individuals and businesses who participated. You are what makes this project doable, fun, and a true success.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="title2 small">Special Awards and Thanks</h2>
            <p>2020 was a year of many firsts: the first website, the first newsletter, first socially-distant planting parties, and the first official calendar of plantings. We also started a few new awards to thank those that really went above and beyond, and who continue to make this project fun, doable, and rewarding.</p>
            <br>
            <ul class="left-justified-list">
              <li><strong>The Daffie Award-</strong> Peg O’Connor received a $50 gift certificate (generously donated by Vinolios) for canvassing her neighborhood as a “head gardener” and eliciting 1700 bulb orders.
              <p><em>*Runner-up: Karna Olsen was a close second with 1600 bulbs ordered with her help for some residents at Penobscot Shores</em></p>
              </li>
              <li><strong>The Daffie Planter Award-</strong> Julie Waters received a $50 gift certificate to Marshall Wharf (thanks so much Dan and Kathleen!) for being part of the most planting parties- 6,050 bulbs were planted in the 6 parties she participated in.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>The Daffie Techie Award</strong> goes to Collin Brewster Cunning for his wonderful development of The Belfast Daffodil Project Website as well as social media outlets such as Facebook and Instagram.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Also, many thanks go out to Lynn Karlin for offering her amazing photographic talents to document all the fun that was had out in the parks- check them out in the Website Gallery!</p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="title2 small">Looking Ahead to 2021</h2>
            <p>Things to look forward to and ways to help as we set our sights on 2021:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Tell all your friends and neighbors about the Project and go to the Website and order bulbs or give a donation for next year- it is never too early</li>
                <li>Consider becoming a “Head Gardener” in your neighborhood. Job description includes telling folks in your area about the project, taking orders and then delivering the bulbs when they arrive</li>
                <li>Become a co-sponsor of the Belfast Daffodil Project- check with the CPO (Chief Planting Officer) Elisabeth Wolfe about the details</li>
                <li>Think about adopting a City Garden . Be in charge of a planting party and watch as the daffodils multiply year after year!</li>
