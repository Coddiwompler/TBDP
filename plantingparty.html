        <h2 class="title2">Come Dig in the Dirt With Us!</h2>
        <p>We're glad you're interested in helping with the "dirty" work! Every year we get thousands of bulbs donated, and we are in constant need of volunteers to come help us put them in the ground. There are two main avenues to get involved with the planting:</p>
        <h3>Join an "Open" Planting Party</h3>
        <p>An "Open" Planting Party is one that we or another volunteer have set up to host, and all you have to do is come and help plant! No organization, no planning, just good times with good people with your hands in the dirt. Please visit our calendar <a href="calendar.html" class="noticable-link">HERE</a> to find a Planting Party that fits into your schedule, and then email us (feel free to use the button below). Afterwards we'll get in touch with you to confirm your spot at the Party. Wahoo!</p>

        <h3>Host Your Own Planting Party</h3>
        <p>In the past we've had people setting up their own Planting Parties. This could simply be you volunteering to host your own "open" Planting Party. It could also be a private planting event for your family, friends, or even a creative way to conduct a business happy hour! Regardless of how you want to do it, we're so happy that you've chosen to get involved. Email us (or use the link below) with your organization or name, and what you have in mind for your planting party, and we'll help you make it happen!</p>

        <h2 class="title2">What to Expect When You Join a Planting Party</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Try to add as much information as possible to your initial email so we can get a good idea of your particular volunteer situation</li>
            <li>Planting Parties range in length of time based on the amount of bulbs to be planted and the amount of volunteers signed up. You don't <em>have</em> to stay for the entire time, but we encourage you to stay for as long as you can</li>
            <li>Look at the weather beforehand to dress appropriately. We rarely cancel planting parties based on weather, but if we do we will contact you via email or text</li>
            <li>If you have them, bring the following equipment. If not, let us know so we can bring extras from the donation bin
                <ul class="equipment-list">
                    <li><em>Shovel</em></li>
                    <li><em>Garden Trowel</em></li>
                    <li><em>Work Gloves</em></li>
                    <li><em>Warm Hat (weather dependant)</em></li>
                    <li><em>Clothing Layers (even on a cold day this can be warm work!)</em></li>
                </ul>

            <p>We understand that there can be alot of questions that need answering before commiting time to any volunteer opportunity. We tried to answer a few of them above, but if there are still some lingering doubts, please don't hesitate to send us an email using the button below:
