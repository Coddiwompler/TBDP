      <h2>Got some questions for us? You've come to the right page! Read on friend.</h2><br>
            <h3 class="accordion">How do you plant a daffodil?</h3>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>Great question! To answer it, we caught our founder and CPO (Chief Planting Officer) Elisabeth Wolfe and got some expert tips. Read on:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Dig holes and plant the Daffodil bulbs with their pointed tops UP and 4 - 7 inches below the soil surface with smaller bulbs placed more shallowly than larger ones. Allow about 4 inches between bulbs. Plant early October through late November. Daffodils are tough and can be planted in 100 degree or 40 degree soil.</li>
                <li>When in bloom, feel free to cut Daffodil flowers for bouquets. This will not hurt the plants. One caution:  Daffodil sap contains a chemical that causes other flowers in the same vase to wilt. This is why you don't see Daffodils mixed with other spring flowers in arrangements.</li>
                <li>After blooming has finished for the season, leave the foliage in place; don't cut it off. The leaves will gather sunlight, create food through photosynthesis and strengthen the bulbs for the future.</li>
                <li>By late spring or early summer the leaves will yellow and die back as the plants slip into dormancy. Foliage may be removed after mid - June or later.</li>
              </ol>
            <p>We plan to catch her on video at one of our planting parties this fall, so stay tuned for that in person tutorial!</p>

            <h3 class="accordion">Do daffodils come back every year?</h3>
            <p class="panel">Yessirie! Daffodils are perennials, a type of plant that bloom every year from bulbs which survive the winter.</p>
        
            <h3 class="accordion">What type of care do daffodils need?</h3>
            <p class="panel">Very little! These hardy little flowers will bloom and grow in all manners of environment. Just be sure to let the gree leaves wither before you remove them (3-4 weeks after blooming)</p>
        
            <h3 class="accordion">Are daffodils beneficial to the enironment?</h3>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>They sure are! They perform many essential functions in our ecosphere, such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Attractive to pollinators</li>
                        <li>Help hold moisture in the soil</li>
                        <li>Prevents soil erosion</li>
                        <li>Provides nutrients for nearby flora</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3 class="accordion">My thumb isn't very green, do I need to plant them myself?</h3>
            <p class="panel">Nope nope nope. The Belfast Daffodil Project has many ways in which you can help us succeed in our goal, not just planting. If you are a local business and have a garden or patch of dirt we could plant daffodils in, click <a href="shareyourgarden.html" class="noticable-link">here</a>. If you don't have any extra space, but would like to help us buy more bulbs, you can visit that page <a href="donate.html" class="noticable-link">here</a>. </p>
